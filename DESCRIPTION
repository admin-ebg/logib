Description: Implementation of the Swiss Confederation's standard analysis
    model for salary analyses
    <https://www.ebg.admin.ch/en/equal-pay-analysis-with-logib> in R. The
    analysis is run at company-level and the model is intended for
    medium-sized and large companies. It can technically be used with 50
    or more employees (apprentices, trainees/interns and expats are not
    included in the analysis). Employees with at least 100 employees are
    required by the Gender Equality Act to conduct an equal pay analysis.
    This package allows users to run the equal salary analysis in R,
    providing additional transparency with respect to the methodology and
    simple automation possibilities.
